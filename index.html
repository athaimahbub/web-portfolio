            <p>
                I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
